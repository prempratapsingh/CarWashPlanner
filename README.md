3. Loosely coupled entities and application workflows 
4. Easy to extend entities and workflows
5. Reusable entities
6. Testability

## Testing
The core entities (View models, services, models, etc) and workflows have been tested with Unit Tests using the TDD approach. 
These are the unit test cases,

2. CalendarViewModelTests 
3. NetworkDataServiceTests 
4. FileDataServiceTests
5. CalendarServiceTests
